# Simple_Perceptron_Study_in_CSharp
This is a simple study for me to get to know a little bit more, and practically, about coding with C#, and also artificial neural network's coding fundamentals. 
All essential code is in file `Program.cs` in directory `Simple_Perceptron_Study_in_CSharp/nn_study/`. The code is pretty much applied from the example code 
from article 
[First neural network for beginners explained (with code)](http://towardsdatascience.com/first-neural-network-for-beginners-explained-with-code-4cfd37e06eaf) 
(Arthur Arnx, 2019).
